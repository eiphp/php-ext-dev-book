The primary objective of this book is helping other developers. I wanted to learn
about extension writing and PHP core and almost no information is available for
PHP 7 right now. So, I'm just documenting it for you on the way ...

If this information was useful for you I would be happy with kudos on twitter or
something. Do share this with others. I also welcome patches.
